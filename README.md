# FastAPI Framework for Deployment
### FastAPI for me is a backend to provide a fast and reliable data exchange between different systems and applications using like Restful API or GraphQL API.

### How to run each folder?

**Windows**
1. Create a virtual environment (Opsional, but if u already had all the version of package ur okay)
2. Use the virtual environment and choose the right `Interpreter`.
3. Install all required package and its version
4. Run FastAPI code (code that call `from fastapi import FastAPI`)
- `python main.py`
**or**
- `uvicorn main:app --reload`

5. Access `http://localhost:8000/docs` on your web browser, but choose the right port.
